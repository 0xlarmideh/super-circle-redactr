# AltSchool Semester 1 Holiday Challenge


### 02- Redactr - Scramble some words from a body of text content

#### Scenario

Your app is to help people safely share content on social media by scrambling portions of the text they donâ€™t want the world to read/see. A user will write/paste the some content into a form field and then specify the words they need to be scrambled (using another field). Note the user is allowed to specify more than one word (separated by space) to be scrambled.
